Password manager documentation

The code is written and it works well in an online IDE or other IDEs, althought integration is the tricky part, with no clear way to integrate my code, my hope is that
moving forward the project managers will see the existence of the code in my possible merge request and take into consideration the idea of a password manager for 
builds that may be shipped to the public, preserving the conditions of each tank without letting other users edit the tank temperature or acidity. In my future I may
look for ways to integrate the code and then issue a merge request to the owners.
